    "## Variable Scopes in C++\n",
    "The time between allocation and deallocation is called the **lifetime** of a variable.  Using a variable after its lifetime has ended is a common programming error, against which most modern languages try to protect: Local variables are only available within their respective scope (e.g. inside a function) and are simply not available outside - so using them inappropriately will result in a compile-time error. When using pointer variables however,  programmers must make sure that allocation is handled correctly and that no invalid memory addresses are accessed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example to the right shows a set of local (or automatic) variables, whose lifetime is bound to the function they are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `MyLocalFunction`  is called, the local variable `isBelowThreshold` is **allocated** on the stack. When the function exits, it is again **deallocated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the allocation of local variables, the following holds: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Memory is allocated for local variables only after a function has been called. The parameters of a function are also local variables and they are initialized with a value copied from the caller. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. As long as the current thread of execution is within function `A`, memory for the local variables remains allocated. This even holds true in case another function `B` is called from within the current function `A` and the thread of execution moves into this nested function call. However, within function `B`, the local variables of function `A` are not known. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. When the function exits, its locals are deallocated and there is now way to them afterwards - even if the address were still known (e.g. by storing it within a pointer). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us briefly revisit the most common ways of passing parameters to a function, which are called *pass-by-reference* and *pass-by-value*.\n",

    "## Passing Variables by Value\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling a function as in the previous code example, its parameters (in this case `myInt`) are used to create local copies of the information provided by the caller. The caller is not sharing the parameter with the function but instead a proprietary copy is created using the assignment operator `=` (more about that later). When passing parameters in such a way, it is ensured that changes made to the local copy will not affect the original on the caller side. The upside to this is that inner workings of the function and the data owned by the caller are kept neatly separate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two major downsides to this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Passing parameters by value means that a copy is created, which is an expensive operation that might consume large amounts of memory, depending on the data that is being transferred. Later in this course we will encounter \"move semantics\", which is an effective way to compensate for this downside. \n",
    "2. Passing by value also means that the created copy can not be used as a back channel for communicating with the caller, for example by directly writing the desired information into the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example on the right in the `pass_by_value.cpp` file. In main, the integer `val` is initialized with 0. When passing it to the function `AddTwo`, a local copy of `val` is created, which only exists within the scope of `AddTwo`, so the add-operation has no effect on `val` on the caller side. So when `main` returns, `val` has a value of 2 instead of 4."

    "## Passing Variables by Reference\n",
    "The second major way of passing parameters to a function is by reference. With this way, the function receives a reference to the parameter, rather than a copy of its value. As with the example of `AddThree` above, the function can now modify the argument such that the changes also happen on the caller side. In addition to the possibility to directly exchange information between function and caller, passing variables by reference is also faster as no information needs to be copied, as well as more memory-efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "A major disadvantage is that the caller does not always know what will happen to the data it passes to a function (especially when the function code can not be modified easily). Thus, in some cases, special steps must be taken to protect ones data from inappropriate modification.\n",

With the second function call in `main`, we are passing a reference to `i`  to `CallByPointer`. Lastly, the function `CallByReference` is called in main, which again takes the integer `i` as an argument. However, from looking at `main` alone, we can not tell wether `i` will be passed by value or by reference.\n",
